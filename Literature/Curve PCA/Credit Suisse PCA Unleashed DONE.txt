(PAGE 4) The underlying data need to be correlated, mean-reverting, preferably non-overlapping,
with sufficient points to ensure the robustness of the results.

(PAGE 9) In the core bonds example, they have decided not to include the third factor which 
represents the curveture effect. They claim this is a strategic decision as it's more valuable 
for curveture effects to be captured as part of the residual.

(PAGE 12) In practice, we find that the overall variance of a position on a yield curve can be
constructed as a linear combination of the variance of the scores.

(PAGE 18) PCA can be used to to construct a curve trade that is factor 1 neutral or a fly trade
that's factor 1 and 2 neutral.

(PAGE 20) Original data can be written as the product of two matrices: the scores and the loadings.
Now simply pick lower number of scores and loadings to reconstruct.

(PAGE 21) Hedge ratio calculation is pretty simplistic. Just calculate the individual asset variances
and divide these to neutralize the total explained variance.
