(PAGE 30) 1x2 call spreads are useful whena  bounce-back is expected.

(PAGE 30) Single -stock implied volatlity trades more in line with realised volatility
than index imlieds. The reason why index implieds are more overpriced than single-stock
implieds is due to the demand from hedgers and structured product sellers.

(PAGE 34) Enhanced call overwriting is the term given when call overwriting is only done 
opportunistically or the parameters (strike or expiry) are varied according to market 
conditions. On the index level, the returns from call overwriting are so high that enhanced 
call overwriting is difficult, as the opportunity cost from not always overwriting is too high. 
For single stocks, the returns for call overwriting are less impressive; hence, enhanced call 
overwriting could be more successful. An example of single-stock enhanced call overwriting 
is to only overwrite when an implied is high compared to peers in the same sector. We note 
that even with enhanced single-stock call overwriting, the wider bid-offer cost and smaller 
implied volatility premium to realised means returns can be lower than call overwriting at the 
index level.

(PAGE 59) Assuming all other inputs are constant, the payout of a delta-hedged option is based on
the variance. However, when examining how much carry is earned, or lost, when delta hedging an option,
it is the difference between realised and implied that matters. This is because the gamma of an option
is proportional to 1/sigma; hence, if volatlitiy doubles the gamma halves.
