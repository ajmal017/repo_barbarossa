(PAGE 37) Stationarity can be tested with Dickey-Fuller and Augmented-Dickey-Fuller tests. 

(PAGE 39) Variance ratio test can be used to detect devieations from random walk.

(PAGE 40) In order to correct for spurious mean-reversion which is induced by the cointegrating
regression itself, the stationarity tests used in the identification of cointegrating relationships
are modified versions of standard tests for stationarity.

(PAGE 55) Adding appropropriate complexity to a model will reduce the error component which is due to
model bias, but at the price of increasing the error component which is due to model variance. 
The minimal error, and hence optimal performance, will lie at a particular level of complexity which achieves
the best balance of bias against variance.

(PAGE 66) Reinforcement learning offers a systematic framework for optimising trading systems in terms of the
actual trading performance or "Payoff" which they produce, rather than in terms of statistical measures of
performance accuracy which my not necessarily translate directly into trading performance.

(PAGE 78) For Cac/Dax, Dicky-Fuller fails to reject random walk although the variance-ratio test and
the performance of a simple implicit statistical arbitrage trading rule strongly rejects random walk.

(PAGE 79) The most straightforward way to exploit statistical arbitrage opportunities in the form of
temporary deviations between assets that are correlated in the long term would simply be to buy the
underpriced asset and sell the overpriced asset whenever a sufficiently large mispricing occurs.
However such an approach incurs unquantified risks in that short term dynamics and exogenous factors
may be acting to increase the deviation, leading to short term loses or "draw downs" before the longer
term relationship is restored. A more principled approach is to use the "mispricing" information as
the basis of a predictive model of the relative returns on the two assets.

(PAGE 72) Introducing non linear models seem to improve the performance quite q bit for a simple cointegration
approach.

(PAGE 87) A disadvantage of cointegration is the low-power of standard unit root cointegration tests at 
detecting predictable components. This weakness of cointegration methodology may in principle be overcome by
replacing the unit root tests with more powerful tests based on concepts such as the variance ratio, however
the distribution statistics for such tests is not known and certainly would be expected to be nonstandard
due to biases induced by the cointegrating regression.

(PAGE 97) Rather than imposing the strict requirement of stationarity, we instead employ a broader range of
tests which are capable of identifying both trending and mean-reverting behavior and which are robust to the
presence of nonstationary component in the time-series dynamics.

(page 98) Tests based on the autocorrelation function are most appropriate at detecting short-term effects such 
as momentum or short-term correction effects. In contrast, unit-root tests and standard variance ratio tests
are most appropriate for observing long term effects, such as distinguishing between stationary and nonstationary 
behavior. Tests based on the overall shape of the variance ratio profile are capable of recognising combinations
of short-term and long-term dynamics which are particulary amenable to statistical arbitrage

network models and avoids excessive estimation variance by using statistical significance testing to control

(PAGE 107) The advantage of employing statistical arbitrage strategies based upon flexible forecasting models 
is that  other deterministic components of the dynamics can be accounted for, in addition to the basic tendency
of mean-reversion. By capturing these additional components in the forecasting model it may be possible both
to decrease risk and increase profitability. A decrease in risk may occur because otherwise unfavorable effects,
such as a short-term momentum acting to temporarily increase the mispricing, can be accounted for in the model forecasts.
An increase in profits may occur because the overall accuracy of the forecasting model will improve due to capturing 
a larger part of the deterministic component in the underlying dynamics.

(PAGE 113) The key elements of the specification of each of the three components of a statistical arbitrage model
(mispricing model, forecasting model and trading rule) are grouped together as a set of "meta parameters". The "fitness"
of the set of meta-parameters is evalueated in terms of the actual trading performance of the overall model, thus
serving to avoid the criterion risk which would arise from seperate optimisation of the different model components.
This process can be seen as avoiding the forecasting bottleneck by allowing feedback from the trading performance to 
be passed back to the other model components, thus closing the modelling loop and allowing joint optimisation of all
model components with respect to a single set of criteria.

(PAGE 116) Whilst the object of cointegration testing is to identify combinations of time-series which are stationary,
our statistical arbitrage modelling is concerned with the more general case of combinations of time-series which simply
contain a predictable component. This generalisation of the cointegration framework is both necessary and useful because
the requirement for strict stationarity is over-restrictive and would cause many potential opportunities for statistical
arbitrage to be overlooked.

(PAGE 127) Aside from cointegration, once can use factor models and PCA. However the author is focusing on cointegration.

(PAGE 140) 400 daily observations are used to select 5 stocks that are the best candidates to replicate a target asset.

(PAGE 146) The reason why standard cointegration tests will in some cases fail to identify potential opportunities 
for statistical arbitrage is simple: it is not the purpose for which the tests are designed. Whilst the object of 
cointegration testing is to identify combinations of time-series which are stationary, statistical arbirage modelling
is concerned with the more general case of combinations of time-series which contain a stationary component, or indeed
any other deterministic component.
