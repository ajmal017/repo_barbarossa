(PAGE 35) Looking at Auto-Correlation function is a good way to detect predictability.

(PAGE 37) Stationarity can be tested with Dickey-Fuller and Augmented-Dickey-Fuller tests. 

(PAGE 39) Variance ratio test can be used to detect devieations from random walk.

(PAGE 40) In order to correct for spurious mean-reversion which is induced by the cointegrating
regression itself, the stationarity tests used in the identification of cointegrating relationships
are modified versions of standard tests for stationarity.

(PAGE 55) Adding appropropriate complexity to a model will reduce the error component which is due to
model bias, but at the price of increasing the error component which is due to model variance. 
The minimal error, and hence optimal performance, will lie at a particular level of complexity which achieves
the best balance of bias against variance.

(PAGE 66) Reinforcement learning offers a systematic framework for optimising trading systems in terms of the
actual trading performance or "Payoff" which they produce, rather than in terms of statistical measures of
performance accuracy which my not necessarily translate directly into trading performance.

(PAGE 78) For Cac/Dax, Dicky-Fuller fails to reject random walk although the variance-ratio test and
the performance of a simple implicit statistical arbitrage trading rule strongly rejects random walk.

(PAGE 79) The most straightforward way to exploit statistical arbitrage opportunities in the form of
temporary deviations between assets that are correlated in the long term would simply be to buy the
underpriced asset and sell the overpriced asset whenever a sufficiently large mispricing occurs.
However such an approach incurs unquantified risks in that short term dynamics and exogenous factors
may be acting to increase the deviation, leading to short term loses or "draw downs" before the longer
term relationship is restored. A more principled approach is to use the "mispricing" information as
the basis of a predictive model of the relative returns on the two assets.

(PAGE 72) Introducing non linear models seem to improve the performance quite q bit for a simple cointegration
approach.
