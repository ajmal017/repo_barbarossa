There seems to be a structural expensiveness of the front month contracts caused by USO etf. If that's the case
some of the following strategies might be profitable.

(1) Ratio Calendar short front
(2) Butterfly where one owns the front month that USO doesn't own. 
Will only work when there's a front month contract that USO doesn't own.
(3) Crude oil against Brent calendars.
