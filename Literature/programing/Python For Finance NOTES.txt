(PAGE 21) A very good demostration of how to speed up vector operations using numpy tricks.

(PAGE 30) How to use conda to create seperate environment and install different versions there.

(PAGE 32) Python Quant Platform seems like a potentially useful way of deploying python via web browser.

(PAGE 36) Different interfaces to use ipython.

(PAGE 43) Markdown an latex format in ipython.

(PAGE 44) Time and prun functions magic functions seem useful

(PAGE 63) The majority of numpy code is implemented in C or Fortran, which makes NumPy, when used in the right way,
faster than pure Python.

(PAGE 72) numpy.where seems to be a useful tool for logical indexing.

(PAGE 86) When parsing string objects, consider using regular expressions, which can bring both convenience and performance
to such operations.

(PAGE 107) Depending on the specific shape of the data structures, care should be taken with regard to the memory layout of arrays.
Choosing the right approach here can speed up code execution by a factor of two or more.
