I've a really hard time to install quantlib for Python 3.4.

Installing quantlib itself wasn't that hard. One needs to add some path names this youtube vidoe seems to be enough:

However following the instructions on this webpage:

https://vineetv.wordpress.com/2015/07/07/installing-quantlib-python-windows/

didn't really solve my problems. What solved my problems was to download binaries from:

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and simply installing them using pip.
