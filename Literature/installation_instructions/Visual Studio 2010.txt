This will be necessary to compile stuff with python 3.4 as python 3.4 
is originally compiled with Visual Studio 2010. 
Microsoft doesn't have Visual Studio 2010 on their webpage. So one can
download an iso file from http://getintopc.com/

To open the iso file one needs to download a free iso opener from http://www.isoopener.com/
